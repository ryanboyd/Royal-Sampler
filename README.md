# Royal Sampler
Takes a large CSV file and subsamples into separate files. Can create both random subsamples (with and without replacement) or "targeted" subsamples of a CSV file. Useful for working with very large datasets that you would like to split into chunks, randomly subsample, or "peek" at specific row ranges.
